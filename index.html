        <p>Born in 1984, on a warm September 4th, within the liberal utopia of San Francisco, Bowie Sessions was the child mismatched pair of silly intellectuals. Since that day, he has been a wild, rambunctious git, who enjoys fun, games, sarcasm, and surprising amounts of generosity. A true extrovert, he prospers in the presence of literally even a particularly easily anthropromorphized fern.</p>
        <p>After serving in the US Army as a Combat Medic from 2003-2011, Bowie moved from the serenity and poverty of California to the cold and economic surplus of Minnesota's Twin Cities for the greatest cause of all: love. Marrying his beloved Lynn, they settled into Shakopee with their two dogs, while Bowie burned away his soul working for the Federal Government within the VA system.</p>
        <p>Escaping the tedium of government service, he has abandoned almost all pretense of success he falsely wove around himself and has dived headfirst into an exciting new career of web development.</p>
