        <p>Born in 1984, on a warm September 4th, within the liberal utopia of San Francisco, Bowie Sessions was the child of a married electronics engineering professor and his assistant. Fortunately, Bowie was born in wedlock and is therefore not a bastard, as both his parents were married at the time, to other people.</p>
        <p>Since that day, Bowie has proved himself a wild, playful, rambunctious sort of git, who enjoys frivolity, games, sarcasm, and surprising bouts of generosity. A true extrovert, he prospers in the presence of literally even a particularly easily anthropromorphized fern.</p>
        <p>After serving in the US Army as a Combat Medic from 2003-2011, Bowie moved from the serenity and poverty of California to the cold and economic surplus of Minnesota's Twin Cities for the greatest cause of all: love. Wifing his beloved Lynn, they settled into Shakopee with their two dogs, while Bowie burned away his soul working for the Federal Government within the VA system.</p>
        <p>Escaping the tedium of government service, he has abandoned almost all pretense of success he falsely wove around him and has dove into Coding Bootcamp with the intent of actually finding something akin to a genuine career that human-sized cheeto puffs can not overly impair. Wish him luck!</p>
